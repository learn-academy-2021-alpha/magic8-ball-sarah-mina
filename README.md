# Magic 8 Ball Activity

In this activity we're going to create a Magic 8 Ball application.  We'll use a React application as a template to run the code that we are going to write for Magic 8 Ball.


### Magic 8 Ball Stories
* As a user, I can type in a question to the magic 8 ball application.
* As a user, when I click submit, I see a random answer displayed.
* As a user, the page is styled, and pleasing to use.

### Getting started

All the code you'll need to write for this app is going to be inside one function in the `/src/App.js` file.

After you accept the assignment (or clone this repo), you'll want to install all the npm packages using Yarn:

```bash
$ cd Challenge-Magic8-Ball-React
$ yarn
```

Then you are ready to start a server to run the application:

```bash
$ yarn start
```

Now you're ready to code!

To get started, find the `getAnswer` function, and write your code. Every time you save your updated file, the browser window displaying your app will reload.

### A note for Cloud 9 users
Once you run the `yarn start` command above,  You'll want to click the 'Preview' button to see your running application.  Should you need to refer to the [Cloud 9 Configuration Instructions](https://github.com/LEARNAcademy/cloud9-config) they can be found in your Syllabus.
